## Description

Using Test Driven Development I built out a C# console application for an ATM. This will give the user the ability to check their balance, withdrawl and deposit. 
They will only be able to use numeric values that are positive and when withdrawing, the numeric values must be equal to or less than their total balance. No decimals will be allowed.
